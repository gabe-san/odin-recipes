        <ol>
            <li>Place corn in a single layer on a large plate; 
                freeze until ready to use, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add water to a large (16-quart) stockpot. 
                Squeeze juice from lemon halves into water, removing and 
                discarding seeds; add squeezed lemon halves, onions, jalapeños 
                (if using), Old Bay, salt, cayenne, garlic heads, and bay leaves. 
                Cover and bring to a boil over high. Add potatoes. Cover pot, and 
                return to a gentle boil over high. Uncover, and boil, undisturbed, for 15 minutes. 
                Add clams and sausage. Cover pot, and return to a gentle boil over high. Uncover, and boil, 
                undisturbed, for 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Add crab legs, shrimp, and frozen corn to stockpot, using tongs to incorporate them into the broth. 
                Cover pot, and let mixture stand, undisturbed, 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the Old Bay Butter Sauce: Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan over high. Reduce 
                heat to low; gradually add butter pieces, whisking until mixture is emulsified and thickened (do not let sauce boil). 
                Remove from heat; stir in parsley, Old Bay, lemon juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and cayenne and transfer to a 
                sauceboat or small serving bowl.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, drain the seafood boil in a colander, using tongs to help transfer ingredients to the colander and 
                then to a serving platter. Serve the seafood boil alongside the warmed Old Bay Butter Sauce.</li>
